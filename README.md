# retail_opti

Add the datasets for a training on Palantir Foundry AIP

Goal:
- have data on sales and stock for a supermarket
- understand how the sales are going, what is selling, what is not
- have a clear view of which products are nearly rotten to put discounts on them, put them in strategic places in the shop
- know what to buy and when
- optimize the drives (take away online) for product availability

data comes from https://github.com/ging/carrefour_basket_data_challenge
